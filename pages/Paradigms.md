- Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.
-
- Common programming paradigms are:
	- + Imperative in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state
		- + Procedural which groups instructions into procedures
		  + [[Object-Oriented Programming]] which groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on.
	- + **Declarative** in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it.
		- * [[Functional Programming]] in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of [[Functions]] applications
		  * **Reactive** in which the desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change.
