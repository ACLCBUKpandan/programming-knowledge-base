- a mode of communication that is used to share ideas, opinions with each other.
- A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers to communicate with computers. [[Computer Programming]]

	-
	- ## Low Level Programming Languages
		- Low-level language is machine dependent ( 0 and 1s) programming language
		- Low-level language is divided into two parts.
		- ### Machine Language
		- Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form(base 16).
		- It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly understand the machine language programs.
		- ### Assembly Language
			- ASM is designed for specific processors.
			- It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form.
			- It uses assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language
	- ## High Level Programming Language
		- is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites.
		- This requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language.
		- The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.
			- Examples:
			  + [[Python]] 
			  + C++
			  + C#
		- ### Procedural Oriented Languages
			- It divides program into small procedures called routines or [[Functions]]
			- Advantage of POP is that it helps programmers to easily track the program flow and code can be reused in different parts of the program.
		- ### Object-Oriented Languages
			- is based upon the [[Objects]].
			- Programs are divided into smaller parts called [[Objects]]. It used to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc. in the program to makes the program reusable, efficient, and easy-to-use.
		- ## Middle-level Programming Language
			- lies between low-level and high-level programming languages.
			- Advantages:
			  collapsed:: true
				- + Supports high-level programming
				- + User-friendly language
				- + Closely related to machine language and human language.
				-
			- Example
			  + C
			  + C++
